## What I learned from this project

- How to build and style a basic form.
- How to validate form data on the client side.
- Forms play a critical role in gathering information from website users.
- It is possible to make forms more user-friendly by choosing the right input element for each piece of information.
- Styling form elements can greatly assist users in understanding what is required of them.
- Web browsers can help with validation but this can easily be bypassed. It is therefore important to sanitise form data on the server side.
